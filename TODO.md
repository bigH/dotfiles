 - a utility to "sprinkle changes on commits" - to go from a commit to a new history with those changes squashed in with the last commit that changed them
 - a utility for viewing which files changed in which commits since master:
```
PATH                          abc123          def1bc        ....
foo/bar                 ++++++++/---             +/-
```
 - explore LF - ranger substitute
 - explore building personal journaling tool
 - explore making the installation env system nicer
    - choose `env` based on hostname
    - given an `env`, there's a facet-list
